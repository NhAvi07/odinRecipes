    <br><p>Sushi is one of the first foods that spring to mind when we think about Japanese cuisine. This delicacy was one of the first Japanese dishes to be exported to the US after the Meiji Restoration in 1868, and since then its popularity has steadily increased year after year.<br>The word ‘sushi’ refers to any dish made with Japanese rice that has been seasoned with rice vinegar. Common varieties of sushi include makizushi (sushi rice and fillings rolled up in nori seaweed), nigiri sushi (shaped, bite-size mounds of sushi rice with single slices of raw fish or similar draped over the top) and inarizushi (sushi rice stuffed inside pockets of inari; a type of seasoned, fried tofu).</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ⅓ cups water</li>
        <li>⅔ cup uncooked short-grain white rice</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons rice vinegar</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons white sugar</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>4 sheets nori seaweed sheets</li>
        <li>½ pound imitation crabmeat, flaked</li>
        <li>1 avocado - peeled, pitted, and sliced</li>
        <li>½ cucumber, peeled, cut into small strips</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons pickled ginger</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Bring water to a boil in a medium pot; stir in rice. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until rice is tender and water has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes.</li>
        <li>Mix rice vinegar, sugar, and salt in a small bowl. Gently stir into cooked rice in the pot and set aside.</li>
        <li>Lay nori sheets on a baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Heat nori in the preheated oven until warm, 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Center 1 nori sheet on a bamboo sushi mat. Use wet hands to spread a thin layer of rice on top. Arrange 1/4 of the crabmeat, avocado, cucumber, and pickled ginger over rice in a line down the center. Lift one end of the mat and roll it tightly over filling to make a complete roll. Repeat with remaining ingredients.</li>
        <li>Use a wet, sharp knife to cut each roll into 4 to 6 slices.</li>
    </ol>
